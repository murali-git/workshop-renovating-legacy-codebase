# Tools we use

## Java based

The tools we used in preparation of the workshop:
* Java version 1.8
* IntelliJ
* Maven
* jenv to ensure the version is the same for both maven and IntelliJ

### Troubleshoot

#### The test succeed in maven / IDE but fail in the other

Probably the java version is not the same. Use jenv to get them the same for both maven and your favorite IDE. With `jenv enable-plugin maven` you can control this also for maven.
